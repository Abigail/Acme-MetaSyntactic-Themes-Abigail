=head1 NAME

Acme::MetaSyntactic::beatles - Singers from the 1960s British rock & roll group.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Beatles were to music what LISP was the programming languages.

This module contains four (sub)themes: C<< first/standard >>, containing
the four first names (John, Paul, George, Ringo) of what we typically 
consider to be the four Beatles. C<< full/standard >> contain the full
names of the fab four: John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and
Ringo Starr. However, in the early years of the band, the drummer was
Pete Best. Hence the additional themes C<< first/early >> and C<< full/early >>,
which swaps Ringo Starr for Pete Best. The default theme is
C<< first/standard >>.

This module is part of the set of C<< Acme::MetaSyntactic >> themes
found in the C<< Acme::MetaSyntactic::Themes::Abigail >> package.
